### A library entirely based on styling CSS cards.

blirWe aims to provide a huge variety of CSS card components.

# Getting started
#### For usage example you can also refer the public folder which contains the html and css files.

Download and add **blirwe.main.css** to your project. After inserting the stylesheet to your html, you can start using the library by assigning the bliCard--X class to your repective div element. Here X is the specific card modifier that you want to use.

Ex: 
 ``` <div class="bliCard--warning">{...content1}  <br/><hr/> {... content2} </div> ```

Here the naming convention is "bliCard--X"
Here X can be replaced by: normal, dark, alert, warning, bliss.

Here is how the cards look with normal and dark modifiers:
